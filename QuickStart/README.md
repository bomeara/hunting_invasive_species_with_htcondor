## Quick Start:

This is the Windows Quick Start Example from the
[HTCondor homepage](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/quickstart.html).
Please see the project homepage for complete documentation.

It has been modified to run the UMESC Windows network. Additionally,
the `queue' has been increased. 

I would recommend you code this yourself rather than coping my
example if you are teaching yourself HTCondor. 
That way, you will understand it better.
I included this example because I used it to debug my Condor pool.
