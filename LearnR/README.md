## Simple example for learning to use R with HTCondor

This example is a simple example that was created to learn how to use
R with HTCondor. 
It assumes that you are running a Windows Flock with R installed on
all of the local machines.
There are three files in this example:

- A Condor submit file.
- A Windows batch file.
- A R script file (in the _data_ folder).

The data folder could also contain data that the R script would use.
