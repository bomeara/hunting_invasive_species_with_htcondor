# R example

This is an example of using HTCondor with R on a Linux system.

Please contact Luke Winslow (lawinslow@gmail.com) for details about
it.

RAE note: I included this because I adapted it for my
examples. However, it may not be easiest to follow unless you are
comfortable with Condor and R already.
